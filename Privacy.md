## How We Collect and Use Information

### Device Permissions

🎤 **Microphone** (if voice input is enabled):
Activated only when you explicitly tap the recording button. Audio data is processed in real-time and will not be stored.

### Zero Personal Information Collection
This app does not require registration or login. We do not collect personal information such as your name, email, device ID, or location. All creative content is stored locally on your device only.

## Data Security
All user data (cards, picture books, settings) is stored locally on your device. You can permanently delete this data via **Settings > Clear Cache**.

## Third-Party Services
- **Pexels Image Library**: Loaded images comply with its [license agreement](https://www.pexels.com/license/).
- **AI Generation Services**: Story and illustration generation runs in isolated environments. Outputs contain no user characteristic data.
